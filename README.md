## The Challenge
The website should have:

- a blog
- charts (line plot and barplot)
- interactive energy check-up and tax check-up
- the ability to send an automatic email to visitors completing the energy check-up
- the ability to store email addresses in a database

Working in team with an Art Director

## Setup

```bash
# Clone the following repository - frontend
$ git clone https://github.com/StefanoFrontini/pilloledienergia.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd pilloledienergia

# Install Gridsome CLI
$ npm install --global @gridsome/cli

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the frontend
$ gridsome develop
```
## What I learned
### Gridsome (Static Site Generator)

Gridsome is a static site generator for Vue.js.

A static site generator is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and a set of templates. Essentially, a static site generator automates the task of coding individual HTML pages and gets those pages ready to serve to users ahead of time. Because these HTML pages are pre-built, they can load very quickly in users' browsers.

Gridsome adds a GraphQL layer that helps you bring data from API's, CMS's with ease at build time.
### Serverless Functions
Serverless functions let you run server-side code without having to run a dedicated server.

Netlify let you code your functions in Javascript. An example of a function called hello.js would be:

```Javascript
exports.handler = async function(event, context) {
    return {
        statusCode:200,
        body: JSON.stringify ({message: "Hello World"})
    }
}
```
That's it! Your little server is ready!

In this project I used Netlify Serverless Functions to send a notification email with nodemailer and to update the database with a graphQL query (FaunaDB).
### Responsive email framework
Responsive email is hard. Each client renders HTML in its own way and some donâ€™t even support HTML, which can cause delivery issues.

I used the MJML framework to send the email to the visitor who completes the energy check-up
### D3 and Vue integration
D3 and Vue both want to handle the DOM.

I decided to let Vue handle the DOM and use the powerful D3 primitives.
